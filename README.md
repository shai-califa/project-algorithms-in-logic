# project-algorithms-in-logic
This repository includes the code of the project which is a version of adusat based on prior implementaion with the addition of the heuristics described in the "Learning Rate Based Branching Heuristic for SAT Solvers" paper by Jia Hui Liang, Vijay Ganesh, Pascal Poupart, and Krzysztof Czarnecki University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada.

The following code was written in Microsoft Visual Studio and we highly suggest compiling it in that environment. We suggest uploading cnf files to the test folder and running the algorithm on them from the command line.

Our main changes can be found in the following functions:

reset_after_assigment

analyze

Decide
